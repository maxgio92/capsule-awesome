## Enforce Pod container image PullPolicy

Bill is a cluster admin providing a Container as a Service platform using shared nodes.

Alice, a Tenant Owner, can start container images using private images: according to the Kubernetes architecture, the kubelet will download the layers on its cache.

Bob, an attacker, could try to schedule a Pod on the same node where Alice is running her Pods backed by private images: they could start new Pods using ImagePullPolicy=IfNotPresent and be able to start them, even without required authentication since the image is cached on the node.

To avoid this kind of attack, Bill, the cluster admin, can force Alice, the tenant owner, to start her Pods using only the allowed values for ImagePullPolicy, enforcing the kubelet to check the authorization first:

```yaml
apiVersion: capsule.clastix.io/v1beta1
kind: Tenant
metadata:
  name: oil
spec:
  owners:
  - name: alice
    kind: User
  imagePullPolicies:
  - Always
```

Allowed values are: `Always`, `IfNotPresent`, `Never`.

Any attempt of Alice to use a disallowed imagePullPolicies value is denied by the Validation Webhook enforcing it.
