## Assign Trusted Images Registries

Bill, the cluster admin, can set a strict policy on the applications running into Alice's tenant: he'd like to allow running just images hosted on a list of specific container registries.

The spec `containerRegistries` addresses this task and can provide a combination with hard enforcement using a list of allowed values:

```yaml
apiVersion: capsule.clastix.io/v1beta1
kind: Tenant
metadata:
  name: oil
spec:
  owners:
  - name: alice
    kind: User
  containerRegistries:
    allowed:
    - docker.io
    - quay.io
    allowedRegex: 'internal.registry.\\w.tld'
```

> In case of Pod containers running from non-FQCI (non fully qualified container image), the container registry enforcement will disallow the execution.
> If you would like to run a busybox:latest container that is commonly hosted on Docker Hub, the Tenant Owner has to specify its name explicitly, like docker.io/library/busybox:latest. 

A Pod running `internal.registry.foo.tld/capsule:latest` as registry will be allowed, as well `internal.registry.bar.tld` since these are matching the regular expression.

> A catch-all regex entry as .\* allows every kind of registry, which would be the same result of unsetting `containerRegistries` at all.

Any attempt of Alice to use a not allowed `containerRegistries` value is denied by the Validation Webhook enforcing it.
