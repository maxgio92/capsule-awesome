# Capsule features

## Self-service
Leave developers the freedom to self-provision their cluster resources according to the assigned boundaries.

## Preventing cluster sprawl
Share a single cluster with multiple teams, groups of users, or departments by saving operational and management efforts.

## Governance
Leverage Kubernetes Admission Controllers to enforce the industry security best practices and meet policy requirements.

## Resources control
Take control of the resources consumed by users while preventing them to overtake.

## Native experience
Provide multi-tenancy with a native Kubernetes experience without introducing additional management layers, plugins, or customized binaries.

## GitOps ready
Capsule is completely declarative and GitOps ready.

## BYOD
Assign to tenants a dedicated set of compute, storage, and network resources and avoid the noisy neighbors' effect.
